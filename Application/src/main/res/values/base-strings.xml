AppNanny is a prototype application-layer Android device watchdog that
     informs users when it detects availability concerns.  The original
     design is informed by the findings of the research produced for
     the 28th Annual IEEE Software Technology Conference (STC) held 
     at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in
     Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA, and published by the IEEE.

     Please visit https://conference.usu.edu/stc/ for more details.
